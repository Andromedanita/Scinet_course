Running 3 test cases...
Running test # 1...
Checking the initial movement of ants with zero velocity in a 1 X 1 table:
Initial number of ants: 1050

Doing timestep 0
Total number of ants: 1050


Running test # 2...
Checking the movement of ants with zero velocity in a 4 X 4 table:
Initial number of ants in square [0][0]: 1000

Doing timestep 0
Total number of ants: 1000


Running test # 3...
Checking if the new number of ants is smaller than the initial ones 
so that ants are not created during the simulation:
Table size is:94
Total initial number of ants:4.40258e+06

Doing timestep 0
Total number of ants: 4.40258e+06
