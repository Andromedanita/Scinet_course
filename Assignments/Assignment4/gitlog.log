* d96236d : fixed everything
* e7c1b7b : output of second part of assignment 2
* 0157490 : no errors while printing the 25 iterations over mass
* 7197f6e : fixed the issue of printing out zero by assiging an initial value to the x_root
* 7aec162 : added mass-extension relation codes but the return value of root is 0 in to the consule while it shows correct inside the for loop
* 1fd3f63 : works for mass of 0.3 but printing on the consule is still 0 even though the root printing inside the loop is correct
* 7d9d399 : finding the minimum by finding the root of the derivative of the energy
* 5125dd6 : finding one minimum
